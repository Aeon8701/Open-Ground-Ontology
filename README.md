# Open-Ground-Ontology  
*Hosting the Perpetualism White Paper and Companion Exegesis*  

## Philosophical Positioning  
This repository exists as scaffolding for disciplined thought and deliberate recalibration in the face of complexity. *The Open-Ground Ontology: A Perpetualist Manifesto* is not a doctrine, nor a closed system — it is a lattice designed to hold absence, tension, and fluid becoming without collapse into rigidity or dissolution.  

Perpetualism rejects the comfort of final answers. It offers instead architectural scaffolding — dynamic, tension-bearing, and open to reconstruction — for those willing to confront complexity with clarity, discipline, and intellectual honesty.  

## Contents  
- **The White Paper:** The full philosophical architecture of Perpetualism.  
- **Companion Exegesis (Appendices):** Structural commentary on classical and contemporary frameworks, definitions, and philosophical divergences.  

## Invitation and Conditions of Engagement  
You are invited to test, challenge, and recalibrate this framework. Contributions and discourse are welcome — but all proposals for modification must be submitted with clear philosophical justification and will be reviewed directly by the author, Aeon Timaeus Crux.  

*Build carefully. Challenge rigorously. Revise only through disciplined tension.*
