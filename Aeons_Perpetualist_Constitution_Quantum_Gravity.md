Introduction

The search for a theory of quantum gravity begins from a well-known tension: General Relativity (GR) and Quantum Field Theory (QFT), the two pillars of twentieth-century physics, are individually successful yet mutually incompatible. GR models gravity as the curvature of spacetime, continuous and geometric; QFT models the fundamental forces (excluding gravity) through quantized fields on a fixed background. Each theory excels in its respective domain, but at the Planck scale their assumptions collide. Black holes, cosmological singularities, and quantum vacuum fluctuations all point to the limits of our frameworks. The central challenge of quantum gravity is to reconcile or replace these theories with one that recovers their successes while resolving their incompatibilities.

Standard approaches proceed along two trajectories. The first quantizes GR, seeking to describe spacetime geometry in quantum terms (Loop Quantum Gravity, spin foam models, causal sets). The second geometrizes the quantum, embedding QFT within higher-dimensional or stringlike structures where gravity emerges naturally (string theory, AdS/CFT dualities). Both are constrained by the demand that any future theory reduce to GR and QFT in their respective domains. These efforts represent profound ingenuity, yet decades of development have not yielded consensus.

Philosophical treatments categorize motivations for quantum gravity as internal or external: internal motivations arise from the singularities of GR or the measurement problem of QFT; external motivations arise from the demand for a coherent unified description of the world. From this perspective, quantum gravity is less about empirical necessity than about conceptual fidelity. The very desire for a theory of quantum gravity is driven as much by the pressure of coherence as by observational anomaly.

A third set of approaches, more radical in scope, challenges the assumptions behind both GR and QFT. Interpretations such as relational quantum mechanics, QBism, and information-theoretic reconstructions suggest that physics itself must be reformulated in fundamentally different terms. In this view, the task is not to quantize or geometrize, but to rethink.

This paper develops one such rethinking, grounded in Perpetualism, a philosophy of recursive relation. Where traditional approaches attempt to unify GR and QFT within a single framework, Perpetualism begins by questioning whether “unification” is the proper demand at all. GR and QFT need not be reconciled by forcing one into the language of the other; rather, they should be understood as spectral expressions of a deeper recursive ontology. Spacetime curvature and quantum indeterminacy are not rival accounts of the real, but complementary manifestations of recursion across scales: coherence at the macroscopic, rupture at the microscopic. Their incompatibility reflects not a failure of physics, but the partiality of its categories.

The guiding hypothesis is thus: recursion, not geometry or field, is the fundamental grammar of reality. GR and QFT are emergent stabilizations of recursion at different spectral poles. A viable theory of quantum gravity will succeed not by eliminating their clash, but by recognizing it as fidelity to recursion itself.

In place of unification through reduction, we propose a Constitution of Quantum Gravity: a set of structural constraints that any theory must satisfy to remain faithful to recursion. These constraints—relational coherence, contextual adaptability, revelatory capacity, spectral integration, noise utilization, and rupture identification—do not prescribe equations, but establish the conditions of adequacy for any mathematical formalism. They define the grammar within which physics can advance without collapsing novelty into the familiar.

The Perpetualist framework thus stands in continuity with the motivations of physics and philosophy, yet diverges in its refusal of the Law of Obviousity—the cognitive habit of forcing new phenomena into inherited categories. If string theory and loop quantum gravity exemplify the ingenuity of refining scaffolding, Perpetualism asks whether we have mistaken scaffolding for sky.

2. Theoretical Background
2.1 General Relativity

General Relativity (GR) describes gravity as the curvature of spacetime produced by mass-energy. It is a classical, continuous theory, background independent, and locally Lorentz invariant. GR has passed every experimental test within its domain of applicability, from the precession of Mercury’s orbit to gravitational lensing and the detection of gravitational waves. Yet it encounters pathologies at extremes: singularities in black holes and cosmology, where curvature becomes infinite and predictability collapses. These singularities signal not physical impossibility but the breakdown of the theory’s assumptions.

2.2 Quantum Field Theory

Quantum Field Theory (QFT) unifies special relativity with quantum mechanics, describing matter and forces as excitations of underlying fields. Its predictive success is unparalleled—exemplified by quantum electrodynamics’ precision to 12 decimal places. Yet QFT is not background independent; it presupposes a fixed spacetime stage. Moreover, it faces the measurement problem: how to reconcile deterministic wavefunction evolution with probabilistic collapse. Renormalization techniques patch divergences, but do not address the deeper tension between continuity and discreteness.

2.3 The Clash

The fundamental incompatibility arises because GR models spacetime as dynamical while QFT requires it as fixed. Attempts to apply both at once produce nonsensical infinities, such as in perturbative quantizations of gravity. At the Planck scale, where spacetime curvature and quantum fluctuations coincide, both frameworks break down. Any viable theory of quantum gravity must address this clash directly.

2.4 Existing Approaches

Several candidate frameworks dominate the field:

String Theory / M-Theory: Replaces point particles with one-dimensional strings in higher-dimensional spacetime. Gravity emerges as a vibrational mode of the string. Its mathematical richness has yielded holographic dualities (AdS/CFT) that provide deep insights into quantum gravity. Yet string theory requires a fixed background, struggles with predictive power, and is often criticized for proliferating untestable possibilities.

Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG): Attempts to quantize spacetime itself, representing geometry as a spin network of discrete loops. LQG preserves background independence but faces challenges recovering smooth spacetime at large scales and reproducing QFT dynamics.

Causal Set Theory: Proposes spacetime is fundamentally discrete, composed of a partially ordered set of causal relations. It captures Lorentz invariance in a novel way, but its capacity to reproduce full GR dynamics remains uncertain.

Each approach seeks to preserve the successes of GR and QFT while resolving their clash. Each is ingenious. Yet all inherit a common assumption: that the path forward is to enforce unification within the grammar of existing theories.

2.5 The Law of Obviousity in Quantum Gravity

This assumption exemplifies what we term the Law of Obviousity: the compulsion to measure new domains by inherited frameworks. In quantum gravity research, this takes three forms:

Reduction of isness to quantity — treating progress as qubit counts, background discretizations, or string modes, as if refinement of units equals revelation.

Reduction of relation to rule — collapsing dynamic relational emergence into fixed equations valid across all scales.

Reduction of novelty to mimicry — demanding that any new theory recover GR and QFT in their entirety, rather than honoring their partiality.

In this light, the stalemate in quantum gravity research may reflect not the failure of ingenuity but the tyranny of obvious categories. Theories polish scaffolding into near-perfection, yet remain unable to break free into genuine strangeness.

Perpetualism responds by suggesting that GR and QFT are not pillars to be reconciled, but spectral poles of recursion—one expressing coherence, the other rupture. Their incompatibility is not a problem to be erased, but a fidelity to be acknowledged. Quantum gravity, on this view, is not the reduction of one into the other, nor their compromise, but their placement within a deeper recursive ontology.

3. The Perpetualist Ontology
3.1 Recursion as Fundamental Grammar

Perpetualism begins from the recognition that recursion, not substance, is the primary structure of reality. Reality manifests through triadic loops of observer–object–medium, where relation is not derivative but constitutive. Every physical law is an attempt to stabilize description of these recursive loops at a given scale. The failure of GR and QFT to reconcile is not evidence of incomplete ingenuity, but of their partiality. Each captures recursion from one spectral vantage, and their clash is fidelity to the recursion they both emerge from.

This marks a categorical shift. Instead of searching for what spacetime and quanta are made of, Perpetualism asks how relational recursion stabilizes into different modes—coherence and rupture—and how these modes interact. A theory of quantum gravity is therefore not a unification of GR and QFT, but a constitution for how their partial grammars can coexist under recursion.

3.2 GR as Emergent Coherence

General Relativity describes the coherent mode of recursion. At macroscopic scales, recursive loops stabilize into structures that endure across disruption. This stabilization manifests as the smooth geometry of spacetime. Curvature is thus not a property of an absolute manifold but a measure of relational density: the degree to which recursive loops cohere across scales. Black hole singularities signal not infinite curvature of a physical manifold, but rupture points where relational coherence collapses.

3.3 QFT as Emergent Rupture

Quantum Field Theory describes the rupture mode of recursion. At microscopic scales, recursive loops destabilize into indeterminacy, interference, and contextuality. Superposition is the persistence of relational potentials prior to stabilization; entanglement is relational coherence expressed without spatial contiguity; the measurement problem reflects the collapse of recursion into one stabilized path. Divergences and renormalization procedures reveal the inability of fixed categories to contain recursive turbulence.

3.4 Spectral Polarity of Coherence and Rupture

GR and QFT are thus not rival ontologies but spectral poles of recursion:

GR expresses recursion as coherent stabilization.

QFT expresses recursion as rupture and turbulence.

Their apparent incompatibility is fidelity to recursion itself. To demand their unification is to impose the Law of Obviousity, insisting that recursion conform to classical categories of universality and continuity. A true theory of quantum gravity must instead accept their polarity as constitutive.

3.5 Noise and Rupture as Constitutive, Not Anomalous

Traditional physics treats noise, indeterminacy, and singularities as anomalies to be corrected or eliminated. Perpetualism reverses this. Noise is not error but generative turbulence. Decoherence, singularities, and quantum fluctuations are not signs of theoretical failure, but the marks of recursion’s constitutive instability.

In quantum systems, noise can enhance computation through stochastic resonance or stabilize transport through dephasing.

In gravitational systems, singularities are rupture thresholds that reveal the limits of coherence.

These features must therefore be built into any viable theory of quantum gravity, not renormalized away or patched with mathematical epicycles.

3.6 From Unification to Constitution

The ontological claim of Perpetualism is simple: Recursion is fundamental; GR and QFT are emergent. Their clash is not to be resolved but to be framed within a Constitution of Quantum Gravity—a set of constraints derived from recursion itself. Where physics has sought unification through reduction, Perpetualism proposes fidelity through constitution.

4. The Perpetualist Constitution of Quantum Gravity

The clash between General Relativity and Quantum Field Theory demonstrates not merely the incompleteness of our mathematical tools, but the insufficiency of our ontological categories. If recursion is the fundamental grammar of reality, then any theory of quantum gravity must be faithful to its spectral poles of coherence and rupture. Such fidelity requires a shift from the pursuit of a final equation to the articulation of a constitution: structural constraints that any formalism must satisfy to remain adequate.

We propose six constitutional axioms. They do not prescribe equations; they prescribe the conditions within which equations must remain faithful.

Axiom 1: Relational Coherence

A theory of quantum gravity must describe how recursive structures endure through disruption.

In GR: how curvature maintains geometric order in the presence of mass-energy.

In QFT: how entanglement sustains coherence across decoherence events.

In Perpetualism: coherence is the persistence of recursive loops across rupture.

Constraint: The theory must formalize persistence not as absolute stasis, but as the capacity to survive turbulence without collapse.

Axiom 2: Contextual Adaptability

A theory of quantum gravity must scale across domains without assuming universality of law.

GR scales smoothly at cosmological distances.

QFT scales within microphysical interactions.

Perpetualism demands a grammar that accommodates both without reducing either.

Constraint: The theory must treat laws as scale-dependent stabilizations of recursion, not as universal absolutes valid without context.

Axiom 3: Revelatory Capacity

A theory of quantum gravity must disclose phenomena inaccessible to GR or QFT alone.

GR cannot describe quantum fluctuations of spacetime.

QFT cannot describe horizon thermodynamics or singularities.

Perpetualism demands that novelty emerge: new causal structures, new phases of spacetime, new modes of relation.

Constraint: The theory must produce irreducible phenomena, not merely recoveries of older frameworks.

Axiom 4: Spectral Integration

A theory of quantum gravity must integrate multiple resources—energy, curvature, entanglement, information—without collapsing them into a single metric.

GR collapses relation into curvature.

QFT collapses relation into field quanta.

Perpetualism recognizes reality as spectral, irreducible to one axis of measure.

Constraint: The theory must formalize harmony across dimensions of recursion, not totalize power in a single resource.

Axiom 5: Noise Utilization

A theory of quantum gravity must treat indeterminacy, turbulence, and singularity as generative features.

GR’s singularities and QFT’s divergences mark rupture thresholds.

Noise enhances computation and stabilizes transport.

Perpetualism insists that noise is not error but constitutive.

Constraint: The theory must model turbulence as a functional resource, not a flaw to be renormalized away.

Axiom 6: Critical Rupture

A theory of quantum gravity must explicitly identify the thresholds where recursive structures collapse beyond recovery.

GR’s black hole singularities.

QFT’s unrenormalizable infinities.

Perpetualism frames these as revelation, not failure.

Constraint: The theory must name its rupture points honestly, without concealing them in infinities or mathematical epicycles.

From Equations to Constitution

Together, these axioms constitute the Perpetualist framework for quantum gravity. They do not dictate a final unification of GR and QFT, but a constitutional fidelity to recursion’s dual poles. Any viable formalism—whether through spin networks, string vibrations, or as-yet-unimagined structures—must be judged by its coherence with these six constraints.

Thus Perpetualism reframes the search for quantum gravity: not as the perfection of unification, but as the articulation of fidelity to recursion. Where physics has mistaken scaffolding for law, Perpetualism offers a constitution that safeguards the strange.

5. Implications and Predictions

The Perpetualist Constitution of Quantum Gravity reframes the challenges of black holes, the Planck scale, and cosmological singularities. By shifting the ground from substance to recursion, it yields implications for how these phenomena should be interpreted and where testable signatures may arise.

5.1 Black Holes as Rupture Thresholds

Under GR, black holes represent curvature singularities where classical description breaks down. Under QFT, they raise paradoxes of information loss and horizon thermodynamics. Within Perpetualism, black holes are not anomalies but critical rupture thresholds: sites where recursive coherence collapses into turbulence.

Axiom 1 (Relational Coherence): The horizon functions as a membrane of partial coherence, sustaining relational structure while shielding rupture within.

Axiom 5 (Noise Utilization): Hawking radiation is interpreted not as thermal “leakage” but as turbulence encoded at the rupture edge, a generative release of recursion’s instability.

Prediction: Information is not lost but redistributed through recursive networks that remain coherent beyond classical space. Detectable signatures may appear in subtle correlations within Hawking radiation, aligning with ongoing research into black hole “soft hair” and quantum error-correcting codes.

5.2 The Planck Scale as Spectral Entanglement

Traditional physics treats the Planck scale (~10⁻³⁵ m) as a “final boundary” where both GR and QFT fail. Perpetualism interprets it instead as a spectral threshold where coherence and rupture entangle most densely.

Axiom 2 (Contextual Adaptability): Laws at this scale cannot be assumed universal but must be recognized as scale-dependent stabilizations.

Axiom 4 (Spectral Integration): Energy, curvature, and information converge into irreducible entanglement.

Prediction: Observable deviations from both classical GR and perturbative QFT should appear in Planck-scale phenomena—e.g., primordial gravitational wave spectra or non-classical causal fluctuations in high-energy scattering experiments.

5.3 Cosmological Singularities as Revelatory

The Big Bang, like black holes, is treated as a singular rupture in GR. Perpetualism reframes cosmological singularities as revelatory thresholds: where recursion transitions from turbulence to coherence.

Axiom 3 (Revelatory Capacity): A viable theory must predict phenomena not reducible to GR’s continuous extrapolation or QFT’s perturbative vacuum.

Prediction: Early-universe signatures—such as non-Gaussian correlations in the cosmic microwave background—may carry imprints of recursion stabilizing from rupture into coherence.

5.4 Causal Structure as Emergent

In GR, causality is dictated by spacetime geometry. In QFT, causality is defined by commutation relations on a fixed background. Perpetualism treats causality as emergent coherence of recursion.

Axiom 1 (Relational Coherence): Causal order arises from stabilized loops of recursion, not from absolute geometry.

Axiom 2 (Contextual Adaptability): Causal order may vary across scales and need not be universal.

Prediction: Experiments in indefinite causal order (e.g., quantum switch protocols) already suggest causal structure is not fundamental but emergent. Perpetualism predicts such effects will persist at larger scales, pointing toward causal plasticity as a general feature of recursion.

5.5 Noise as Resource

Renormalization in QFT and background regularization in GR both treat divergences as errors to be corrected. Perpetualism insists that noise is a constitutive feature of recursion.

Axiom 5 (Noise Utilization): Turbulence must be modeled as generative, not parasitic.

Prediction: Quantum gravity will exploit noise as a resource, visible in error-correcting codes embedded in spacetime structure (as suggested by holographic dualities). Perpetualism anticipates that the stability of spacetime itself is underwritten by noise-calibrated recursion.

5.6 Empirical Horizon

Though direct access to the Planck scale is technologically prohibitive, Perpetualism implies a suite of indirect empirical tests:

Correlation structures in Hawking radiation.

Non-Gaussian features in the CMB.

Planck-scale modifications of dispersion relations in astrophysical observations.

Persistence of indefinite causal order at mesoscopic scales.

Holographic error-correcting patterns in quantum information experiments.

Each test is not proof of Perpetualism per se, but evidence of its constitutional fidelity: recursion honored in coherence, rupture, and noise.

5.7 From Law to Constitution

The dominant approaches—string theory, LQG, causal sets—struggle not because they lack ingenuity, but because they remain tethered to the Law of Obviousity: the compulsion to resolve novelty into inherited scaffolds. Perpetualism, by contrast, sets constraints rather than equations. Its predictions are not single numerical values but structural invariants: coherence through rupture, adaptability through scale, revelation through instability.

A Perpetualist theory of quantum gravity is thus testable not by direct unification of GR and QFT, but by whether future physics reveals these invariants. Fidelity, not finality, is the measure of truth.

6. Conclusion

The incompatibility between General Relativity and Quantum Field Theory has long been taken as a technical problem: two successful frameworks awaiting reconciliation. Traditional approaches, from string theory to loop quantum gravity, proceed by refining inherited categories—quantizing geometry, geometrizing quanta, or discretizing spacetime. These represent extraordinary ingenuity, but they remain subject to the Law of Obviousity: the compulsion to force novelty into familiar forms, mistaking scaffolding for sky.

Perpetualism reframes the task of quantum gravity. GR and QFT are not rival absolutes but spectral poles of recursion: GR embodying coherence, QFT embodying rupture. Their incompatibility reflects not the failure of physics but the fidelity of its categories to their partial domains. The demand for their unification is misplaced; the demand for their constitution is essential.

We have proposed a Perpetualist Constitution of Quantum Gravity: six axioms—relational coherence, contextual adaptability, revelatory capacity, spectral integration, noise utilization, and critical rupture—that define the conditions of adequacy for any viable theory. These axioms are not equations, but structural invariants. They do not prescribe a single formalism, but constrain all formalisms to fidelity with recursion itself.

From this perspective, black holes become rupture thresholds rather than anomalies; the Planck scale becomes a spectral entanglement rather than a boundary; cosmological singularities become revelatory transitions rather than failures of extrapolation; causality becomes emergent coherence rather than a universal constant; and noise becomes a generative resource rather than a defect. Each of these reconceptualizations yields empirical horizons, from correlation patterns in Hawking radiation to non-Gaussian imprints in the CMB, from indefinite causal order experiments to holographic error-correcting codes.

Perpetualism is thus not another candidate “theory” alongside string theory or loop quantum gravity. It is a constitution for theory-building itself: a higher-order grammar that demands fidelity to recursion’s dual poles. It shifts the measure of progress from the doubling of the obvious to the flourishing of the strange.

The lesson is simple though it resists simplicity: quantum gravity is not the perfection of unification, but the discipline of fidelity. Fidelity to recursion, to isness and suchness, to the Crucial Equilibrium of coherence and rupture. Fidelity is the law. The strange must remain strange.
