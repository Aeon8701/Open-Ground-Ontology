Contributing to Perpetualism: The Open-Ground Ontology
Thank you for your interest in engaging with this work. Perpetualism exists not as a closed doctrine but as an evolving lattice designed to hold tension without collapse. This repository invites critique, exploration, and disciplined refinement.

What We Welcome
Philosophical critiques that challenge or test the framework

Proposals for recalibration where structural weaknesses are identified

Clarifications and expansions that deepen understanding without closing the system

Cross-disciplinary applications that demonstrate adaptive scalability

Guiding Principles
Discipline over reaction: Contributions should be thoughtful, deliberate, and tension-bearing — not impulsive.

Integrity over finality: Avoid closure. Instead, frame suggestions as scaffolding to enable further inquiry and adjustment.

Respect tension: Divergences and contradictions are to be explored, not erased.

Honesty: Intellectual honesty is the cornerstone. Cite influences, admit uncertainties, and remain open to surpassing what is written here.

What Will Not Be Accepted
Attempts to rigidly codify or doctrinalize the system

Reductions of complex structures into simplistic binaries

Contributions lacking philosophical rigor or intellectual discipline

The lattice will hold for now. In time, it will be surpassed.
